# Expense_tracker

Expense Tracker
A personal finance app to track expenses and income.

Team
The names of the team members are: Heritage Adeleke, Adetunji Fatai and Reagan Esabwa

Adetunji Fatai: Project design and Architecture
Heritage Adeleke: The framework of the project

Technologies:
The technologies to be used are as follows:
Languages: We will use a combination of programming languages, such as Python (for back-end) and JavaScript (for front-end).
Front-end Framework: We will utilize a front-end framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for building a responsive UI.
Back-end Framework: We will use a web framework like Django or Flask for the back end.
Database: We will choose a relational database system (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store financial data.
Mobile App: We will be using Flutter for mobile app development.

Challenge:
Problem intended to solve: The project aims to solve the problem of financial management by providing users with a tool to track their income and expenses, categorize transactions, set budgets, and generate financial reports, helping users gain insights into their spending habits, adhere to budgets, and plan for the future.
What the project will not solve: The project won't directly handle real-time financial transactions, integrate with banking systems for automatic transaction retrieval, or provide investment advice. It also won't solve issues related to personal financial discipline.
Who the Portfolio Project will help and/or who the users will be: The portfolio project will benefit individuals, families, or anyone interested in managing their finances more effectively. The user base may include people of various income levels and financial literacy.
Is this project relevant or dependent on a specific locale: The project will not be dependent on a specific locale, as the principles of personal finance management are universal. However, currency formatting and language localization may be importantly considered for international users.

Risks:
The technical risks, the potential impact, and what safeguards or alternatives in mind:
Security: The handling of sensitive financial data requires robust security measures. This risk will be mitigated by following best practices for encryption, authentication, and access control.
Data Integrity: Data consistency and integrity are crucial. We will Implement database constraints and validation checks to prevent data corruption.
Data Loss: We will consider data backup and recovery mechanisms to mitigate data loss risks.
Scalability: If the user base grows significantly, the system may require scalability. We will choose a cloud platform with scalability features.

Non-technical risks, the potential impact, and what strategies are in place to prevent these negative outcomes:
User Adoption: We will ensure the app is user-friendly and provides educational resources to help users adopt it effectively.
Data Privacy: We will address user concerns about data privacy and clearly communicate how their data will be used and protected.

Infrastructure:
Describe your process for branching and merging in your teamâ€™s repository:
Use a standard Git branching strategy (e.g., GitHub Flow) with branches for features, bug fixes, and releases. Ensure code reviews are conducted before merging branches into the main branch.
Describe your strategy for deployment:
We will utilize a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the deployment process, ensuring efficient and reliable updates to the app.
Describe how you will populate your app with data:
We will implement data input forms in the app to allow users to manually add transactions. For advanced functionality, consider integrating with financial data providers or offering import/export options for data in common formats.
Describe what tools, automation or process you will use for testing:
Use testing frameworks for automated testing and implement a rigorous testing strategy that covers all aspects of the application, including functionality, security, and performance.
